# Wish list and remaining issues

- More possibilities for `strel`.


- Check doc. for math morphology and bilateral filter.

- Make doc. for van Herk-Gil-Werman algorithm more direct to found.

- Homogenize names: `LocalFilters.reversed` and `LocalFilters.centered` or
  `reverse_kernel` and `center_kernel`. The former makes more sense since the
  methods can be applied to other things than a kernel. There should be a
  `LocalFilters.reversed_conjugate`?
