# Wish list and remaining issues

- Implement other boundary conditions.

- `localmap` can extract ROI as a vector or a `N`-dimensional sub-array with
  indices relative to the sliding window.

- Consistency: more possibilities for `strel` (like building a kernel) and
  `is_morpho_math_box` should yield `true` for any acceptable arguments for `box`.

- Check doc. for math. morphology and bilateral filter.

- Write doc. for van Herk-Gil-Werman algorithm and make it more direct to found.

- Homogenize names: `LocalFilters.reversed` and `LocalFilters.centered` or
  `reverse_kernel` and `center_kernel`. The former makes more sense since the
  methods can be applied to other things than a kernel. There should be a
  `LocalFilters.reversed_conjugate`?

- Doc. generated by `Documenter` does not contains all docstrings. Perhaps see
   https://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-to-merge-docstrings-of-constructors-with-and-without-type-parameters/42830/4

- Document `localfilter` with a single function.

- Document `localmap`.

- Document `localreduce`.

- Specialize `localmap` so that `localmean(A,B)` becomes `localmap(mean,A,B)`.

- See `ImageFiltering.jl` for speedup `localmap`.
