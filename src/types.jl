"""
    LocalFilters.IntegerRange

is the abstract type of integer-valued ranges.

"""
const IntegerRange = OrdinalRange{<:Integer,<:Integer}

"""
    LocalFilters.Axis

is the union of types suitable to specify a neighborhood axis. It may be an
integer (assumed to be the length of the axis) or an integer-valued range. This
is also the union of types accepted by the
[`LocalFilters.neighborhood_range`](@ref) method.

"""
const Axis = Union{Integer,IntegerRange}

"""
    CartesianUnitRange{N}

is an alias for a `N`-dimensional Cartesian index range with unit step. Since
Julia 1.6, non-unit step Cartesian ranges may be defined.

"""
const CartesianUnitRange{N} = CartesianIndices{
    N,<:NTuple{N,AbstractUnitRange{Int}}}

"""
    LocalFilters.Indices(A...) -> indices

yields a callable object that can be used to produce ranges of indices for each
of the arrays `A...`. These ranges will all be of the same type: linear index
ranges, if all arrays `A...` are vectors implementing fast linear indexing,
Cartesian index ranges otherwise.

The returned object is similar to the `eachindex` method but specialized for a
style of indexing, it can be used as `indices(B...)` with `B...` any number of
the arrays in `A...` to yield a suitable index range to access all the entries
of array(s) `B...`. If `B...` consists in several arrays, they must have the
same indices.

"""

"""
    LocalFilters.Window{N}

is the union of types of arguments which are not a kernel but which may define
a simple `N`-dimensional hyper-rectangular sliding window and that can be
converted into a kernel by the [`LocalFilters.kernel`](@ref) method or by the
[`LocalFilters.Box`](@ref) constructor.

"""

                        CartesianUnitRange{N}}

"""
    LocalFilters.Box{N}(args...)

yields an abstract array whose elements are all `true` and whose axes are
defined by `args...`. This kind of object is used to represent
hyper-rectangular sliding windows in `LocalFilters`. Type parameter `N` is the
number of dimensions, it may be omitted if it can be deduced from the
arguments.

operations.

is an exported constant object used to indicate *forward* ordering of indices in local
filter operations. It can be called as:

    ForwardFilter(i, j) -> j - i

to yield the index in the filter kernel. See also [`ReverseFilter`](@ref) for *reverse*
ordering and [`LocalFilters.localindices`](@ref) for building a range of valid indices
